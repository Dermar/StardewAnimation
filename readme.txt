# This is a huge folder! Maybe just download 'output.mov' if you want to see how it turned out.

This is an animation about my favourite game: Stardew Valley. I always hate it when people sleep in the game before the day is up,
so the general story is about a player who's slept the first two years of their game away. The grandpa who died and gave
them their legacy is not particularly happy about that!

# Output video:
Please open 'output.mp4' to see my output video. It has a little bit of audio so it may be a better experience for 
you to watch it with audio on! Also, I deeply apologise for the uncentred objects! I was working on a large screen and didn't notice until it was extremely late.

# Steps to get the source code running:
1. Download Processing if you don't already have it.
2. Inside the folder you are currently in, please double-click 'stardew_nothing.pde' to open my source-code with Processing. 
3. I've unfortunately only formatted my output for screens of size 2560x1440, and trying to run my code on a screen not of this size will cause a crash.
If your screen is not of size 2560x1440, please go into the 'resources' folder and resize 'bg.png', 'inside_bg.png', and 'opening.jpg' to your screen size.
Once you do this, you should be able to press the play button in the top left corner of processing and see my output. 
Please note that this will still produce different output to the output video since I've set many objects to be particular locations with a screen of size 2560x1440 in mind.
4. You can control the player character with the arrow keys, simply press where you'd like your player to go. 
Note that you need to go into the bed three times to trigger the last scene.
